The MVC application has been designed to streamline the management of project and client data, offering an intuitive interface and robust functionality for various stakeholders. Hereâ€™s how stakeholders will interact with and benefit from the application:

Client and Project Management:

View and Manage Records: Stakeholders can easily view, create, edit, and delete records for clients and projects. The application provides distinct sections for managing client information and project details, ensuring that users can efficiently handle data related to both entities.
User-Friendly Interface: The application features a user-friendly interface with navigation menus and forms that allow stakeholders to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with minimal effort.
Application Functionality:

Clients Section: Users can access a comprehensive list of clients, view detailed information, and make changes as needed. This section supports the creation of new client records, updating existing ones, and removing clients who are no longer active.
Projects Section: Similarly, stakeholders can manage project records through the projects section. This includes adding new projects, editing project details, and deleting outdated or irrelevant projects.
Database Interaction:

Real-Time Data Access: The application is connected to a SQL Server database, ensuring that all client and project data is stored securely and can be accessed or modified in real-time. This facilitates accurate and up-to-date information for decision-making.
Security and Compliance:

Data Protection: To maintain security, the application adheres to best practices for protecting sensitive information. Credentials and connection strings are securely managed to prevent unauthorized access.
User Authentication: The application integrates with identity management systems to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify data, thereby safeguarding against potential data breaches.
